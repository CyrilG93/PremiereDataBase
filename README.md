## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Extension doesn't appear in Premiere Pro

1. Make sure you've enabled unsigned extensions:
   - **macOS**: `defaults write com.adobe.CSXS.11 PlayerDebugMode 1`
   - **Windows**: Add `PlayerDebugMode = 1` in Registry at `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Adobe\CSXS.11`
2. Restart Premiere Pro after installation

### Files not appearing in database

1. Check that your database path is correctly set in settings
2. Verify file extensions are not in the excluded list
3. Click the refresh button to rescan

### Import fails

1. Verify the files exist and are accessible
2. Check Premiere Pro console for error messages
3. Ensure you have write permissions to the project folder (if consolidate is enabled)
